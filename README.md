# GifTastic

### Overview

In this assignment, I used the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of the user's choice. I call the GIPHY API and use JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of the site.

## How GifTastic Works

The theme for GifTastic is TV Shows. An array of strings related to TV Shows is already set. The app is able to take in a user's input to dynamically create buttons in my HTML. 

When a button is clicked, the top 10 results for that search on Giphy is displayed along with the ratings. 

They are displayed as still images. When an image is clicked, the animation starts. When the image is clicked again, the animation stops.
